I bought a [DIY set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3VNJBZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) for Zoltan several years ago. But because of its complexity and the time it would take to do it, he never had the chance to start on it. On a cold winter night, I decided to try it since I have never done this kind of modeling before. It turned out to a big time sucker. I finished on and off after two weeks, totaling two full days on it.

The set has multiple parts, each requiring a different skill set.

### Books
Books are interesting. But there are millions of them. There are two types of books. The first type has the real pages. The second one just uses a small piece of wood to represent the pages.

### Furniture
Furniture is all made of wood. The wood needs the glue specifically for modeling, which takes a few minutes to dry. The long wait time gives the flexibility to adjust the position of the pieces. Because of that, it takes time to finish one whole piece as you will need to wait for the glue between some parts to be dry before continuing.

The red couch is made of cloth and wood. This one is the hardest to make.

### Small decorations

### Photos and Paintings
The frames are made of cardboard or wood.

### Light
Zoltan helped with the light. The frame of the light is metal, so it is a bit tricky to shape it. He also soldered the wires and connected them with the battery.

My thoughts of modeling is that it is not really a creative activity as you are just following the steps that have been tested by the professionals. But it could be a good first step to design your own models. The result is nice. We get decorations for the house anyway, why not make them yourselves? And the process requires so much focus, patience, and meticulosity!
