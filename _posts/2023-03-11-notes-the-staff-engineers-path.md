## The Big Picture
### The job of a staff engineer
* Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It’s up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you.
* You’re in a leadership role, which requires technical judgment and solid technical experience.
* Be clear about your scope, i.e. your area of responsibility and influence.
* Be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that’s important and that isn’t wasting your skills.
* Align with your management chain about your job and set expectations explicitly.

### Understanding your role
* Position in the reporting chain
  * Reporting high:
    * The information you get will be high-level and impactful, and so will the problems you’re asked to solve.
    * Your manager might have less visibility into your work and therefore might not be able to advocate for you or help you grow.
  * Reporting low:
    * You’ll get more focused attention from your manager, and you’ll be more likely to have an advocate.
    * You may have less to learn from your manager, and they might not be helpful for career development. An engineer assigned to a single team may find it hard to influence the whole organization.
* Scope
  * Definition: the domain, team, or teams that you pay close attention to and have some responsibility for.
  * Inside your scope, you should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals. Be aware of the major decisions being made and have opinions about changes and represent people who don’t have the leverage to prevent poor technical decisions that affect them. Be prepared to ignore your scope when there’s a crisis.
  * Too broad scope
    * Lack of impact: If anything can be your problem, then it’s easy for everything to become your problem.
    * Becoming a bottleneck: you may slow people down because they can’t manage without you.
    * Decision fatigue: You'll have the constant cost of deciding which things to do
    * Missing relationships: harder to have enough regular contact to build the sorts of friendly relationships that make it easier to get things done.
  * Too narrow scope
    * Lack of impact: you may spend all your time on something that doesn’t need the expertise and focus of you. If you choose to go really deep on a single team or technology, it should be a core component, a mission-critical team.
    * Opportunity cost: you may not be top of mind for solving a problem elsewhere in the org, or your manager may be unwilling to let you go.
    * Overshadowing other engineers: you may overshadow less experienced people and take learning opportunities away from them.
    * Overengineering: An engineer who’s not busy can be inclined to make work for themselves.
* Shape of your role
  * Depth-first or breadth-first?
  * Four disciplines
    * Core technical skills
    * Product management: Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work
    * Project management: The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what’s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked
    * People management: Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems
  * How much to code?
  * How’s your delayed gratification?
    * If you’re going to be anxious and stressed out on a project with longer feedback cycles, ask a manager who you trust to tell you, regularly and honestly, how things are going. If you need that and don’t have it, consider projects that pay off on a shorter timescale.
  * Manager track?
  * Archetypes
    * Tech leads: Partner with managers to guide the execution of one or more teams.
    * Architects: Responsible for technical direction and quality across a critical area.
    * Solvers: Wade into one difficult problem at a time.
    * Right hands: Provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations
  * Primary focus
    * Everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important. Know why the problem you’re working on is strategically important—and if it’s not, do something else.
    * Try to choose a problem that actually needs you and that will benefit from your attention.

### Three maps
A Locator Map
* It’s tricky to be objective about any work while you’re deep inside it. Unless you can maintain perspective, the concerns and decisions of your local group will feel more important to you than they would if you looked at them on a bigger scale. The map helps you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.
* Risks
  * Prioritizing badly: When everyone around you cares about the same set of things, it’s easy to magnify the importance of those things.
  * Losing empathy: It’s easy to over focus and forget that the rest of the world exists, or start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich, nuanced domain.
  * Tuning out the background noise: you get used to the problems in your space and stop thinking of it as something that needs to be fixed.
  * Forgetting what the work is for: Being in your silo can mean that you lose your connection to what’s going on elsewhere in the company.
* Seeing Bigger
  * Taking an outsider view
  * Seeking out peers in other groups is an important part of your job. Build friendly relationships with other staff engineers. Get to a point where you can speak the truth to one another, and it won’t be contentious
  * Go beyond engineering: build relationships with product folks, customer support, administrative staff, and more. If your work affects them or their work affects you, go be friendly and understand their point of view. It will give you a whole new way of thinking about what’s important to your department or your business.

A Topographical Map: Learning the Terrain
* Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization’s “personality” and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the “shadow” organization charts. The map helps highlight the friction and gaps between teams and open up the paths of communication.
* Reorganizations can disrupt communication between groups that need to work closely together. Teams that are under a heavy load can entrench and put up barriers. A new senior leader can cause an earthquake that reshapes the landscape overnight.
* Difficulties
  * Your good ideas don’t get traction
  * You don’t find out about the difficult parts until you get there: if you know where people got stymied in the past, you can take a different path or solve the hardest part of the problem first, so other people will be convinced the project is worth their effort.
  * Everything takes longer: Unless you know how your organization works, decisions that should be straightforward will take months or quarters. The mechanics of your organization’s planning cycles will affect you too.
* Understanding Your Organization
  * What's the culture?
    * Secret or open?
    * Oral or written?
    * Top-down or bottom-up?
    * Fast change or deliberate change?
      * In a more deliberate environment, you’ll need to show that you’ve thought through the whole plan.
    * Back channels or front doors?
      * How do people in different groups talk with each other? There may be formal paths for information and requests, but your social culture adds informal channels too.
    * Allocated or available? Understaffed or overworked?
    * Liquid or crystallized in hierarchy?
  * Noticing the points of interest
    * Chasms: Group cultures, norms, goals, and expectations evolve differently, causing gaps that make it difficult to communicate, make decisions, and resolve disputes.
    * Fortresses: teams or individuals who seem determined to stop anyone from getting projects done. To pass through the fortress gates, you might need to bring a token of sponsorship from someone the gatekeeper respects, or know the password to lower the drawbridge. (Common passwords include proving that you’ve mitigated all of the risks of your proposed change, completing lengthy checklists or capacity estimates, or replying to huge numbers of document comments with acceptable answers.) Another option is a protracted, bloody battle where you argue every point and pull other people into the fight. Or you can give up and go the long way around the fortress, complicating your journey and losing access to any wisdom the gatekeeper would have shared.
    * Disputed territory: It’s very hard to draw team boundaries in a way that lets each team work autonomously. When two or more teams need to work closely together, the lack of alignment can lead to power struggles and wasted effort as both sides try to “win” the technical direction. Overlaps in team responsibilities make this worse, complicating decision making and wasting everyone’s time.
    * Uncrossable deserts: unwinnable battle. May be a project that’s just too big or a politically messy situation that always ends with a veto from some senior person. Whatever it is, people have tried it before, and any suggestion of tackling it again will be met with discouragement and ennui.
    * Paved roads, shortcuts, and long ways around: Sometimes the official way is the way that everyone learns not to use.
* Points of Interest
  * How are decisions made?
    * If you don’t understand how decisions are made in your organization or company, you’ll find yourself unable to anticipate or influence them.
  * Where is “the room”?
    * If you’re not seeing how your organization works, ask someone you trust to walk you through where a particular decision came from. (Be clear that you’re not fighting the decision, just trying to understand the inner workings of your organization.)
    * Beware: there might not be a “room” at all. At the most extreme ends, major technical pronouncements might get made in one-on-ones with the most senior leader, or they might be intended to be entirely bottom-up.
  * Asking to join in
    * Reasons should be about impact to your organization, not to you personally. Show that you can add value to the room, and you need to reduce the cost of including you: show up prepared, speak concisely, and be a collaborative, low-friction contributor.
  * The shadow org chart
    * While it’s important to understand who the official technical leaders are, it’s just as important to understand who they listen to and how they make decisions. These influencers are the people you need to convince before a change can happen.
* Keeping Your Topographic Map Up to Date
* If the Terrain Is Still Difficult to Navigate, Be a Bridge

A Treasure Map: destination and points on a trail to get there
* When nobody has declared what the treasure is, or everyone disagrees on how to get to it, a staff engineer can have a huge impact by creating a vision or strategy, making decisions, or otherwise drawing a brand-new treasure map for the organization. The map helps you make sure everyone knows exactly what they’re trying to achieve and why.
* Limitations of short-time thinking
  * If the team doesn’t know the big plan, either they’ll go to the wrong place, or every decision will be long, complicated, and full of discussion.
  * You won’t finish big things
  * You’ll accumulate cruft
  * You’ll have competing initiatives
  * Engineers stop growing: A team that’s used to iterating on short, clearly specified goals won’t build muscle for bigger, more difficult projects and won’t be able to tell the story of why they did what they did.

### Creating the big picture
#### Vision and strategy
Technical vision:
* A technical vision is sometimes called a “north star” or “shining city on the hill.” It doesn’t set out to make all of the decisions, but it should remove sources of conflict or ambiguity and empower everyone to choose their own path while being confident that they’ll end up at the right place.
* There’s no particular standard for what a vision looks like. It could be a pithy inspirational “vision statement” sentence, a 20-page essay, or a slide deck. It might include:
  * A description of high-level values and goals
  * A set of principles to use for making decisions
  * A summary of decisions that have already been made
  * An architectural diagram
* It should be clear and opinionated, it should describe a realistic better future, and it should meet your organization’s needs.

Strategy
* A strategy is a plan of action. It’s how you intend to achieve your goals. That means understanding where you want to go (this could be the vision) as well as the challenges in your path.
* It could be a one-page or a 60-page behemoth. It might include:
  * A diagnosis of the current state of the world, including specific challenges to be overcome
  * A clear path forward for addressing those challenges
  * A prioritized list of projects that should be tackled, perhaps with success criteria for those projects.
  * Depending on its scope, it could include broad, high-level direction or decisions on a specific set of difficult choices, explaining the trade-offs for each one.

Technical visions and strategies bring clarity, but they can be overkill for a lot of situations. If everyone can get aligned without the document, you probably don’t need it.

#### The Approach
* Embrace the Boring Ideas: usually what’s needed is someone who’s willing to weigh up all of the possible solutions, make the case for what to do and not do, align everyone, and be brave enough to make the (potentially wrong!) decision.
* Join an Expedition in Progress
  * Share the lead: You can bring leadership to an existing project without taking over. Suggest a formal split that gives each of you a chance to lead in a compelling way.
  * Follow their lead: If they’re less experienced than you, you can have a huge impact by nudging them in the right direction and helping make the work as good as it can be.
  * Step away
* Get a sponsor
  * A sponsor helps clarify and justify a vision or strategy. Sponsorship can help build consensus The sponsor can set success criteria and act as a tiebreaker when decisions are stuck in committee. They can nominate a lead or “decider” — sometimes called a directly responsible individual (DRI).
  * Maximize your chances by bringing the potential sponsor something they want. Make a proposal that matches the director’s own goals or solves a problem they care about. The sponsor will also have some “objectives that are always true”: if you can make their teams more productive or (genuinely) happier. Think about and practice your “elevator pitch” before trying to convince a sponsor to get on board with your project.
  * A sponsor needs the power to decide what an organization spends time and staffing on, and such decisions are usually up to the local director or VP.
  * Once you have the sponsorship, check in enough to make sure you still have it.
* Choose your core group
  * Working in a group also lets you pool your contacts, social capital, and credibility, so you can reach a broader swathe of the organization.
  * Aim to recruit a small core group to help you create the document, as well as a broader group of general allies and supporters.
  * If there are dissenters who will hate any decision made without them, you have two options: make very sure that you have enough support to counter their naysaying, or bring them along from the start.
  * Keep the core group manageable: two to four people (including you) is ideal. Outside the core team, you can offer more lightweight involvement.
  * Let your group have ideas, drive the project forward, and talk about it without redirecting all questions to you. Offer opportunities to lead, and make sure you’re supportive when they take initiative. Their momentum will help you move along faster, so don’t hold them back.
* Set scope
  * Aim to cover enough ground to actually solve your problem, but be conscious of your skill level and the scope of your influence. Include people from the team you are making changes to, or have a sponsor who has influence there.
  * Work around your fixed constraints, rather than ignoring them or wishing they were different.
  * Be prepared to revisit your vision at intervals and make sure it’s still the right fit for your organization. As you make progress on your vision or strategy, you may find that your scope changes.
* Make Sure It’s Achievable
  * If you decide that the problem isn’t solvable, or at least not by you, you have five options:
    * Lie to yourself, cross your fingers, and do it anyway.
    * Recruit someone who has skills that you’re missing, and either work with them or ask them to lead the project (and give you a subsection of it to hone your skills on).
    * Reduce your scope, add in the fixed constraints, and start this chapter again with a differently shaped problem to solve.
    * Accept that nobody’s going to write a vision/strategy to solve the problems you can see, conclude that your company will probably be OK without one, and go work on something else.
    * Accept that nobody’s going to write a vision/strategy to solve the problems you can see, conclude that your company won’t be OK without one, and update your resume.
* Make It Official
  * As soon as you can. If you set everyone’s expectations, you’re less likely to meet with competing efforts — or at least you’ll find out about them early.

#### The Writing
* The Writing Loop:
  * Timebox this work and give yourself some deadlines.
  * Inherit company constraints
  * Align with organization plans
  * Weigh up smaller scoped documents and understand the disruption that will cause
  * Iterate as you talk to other people and decide what to do next.
* Make decisions
  * Trade-offs: "While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.” This framing makes the trade-offs clear.
  * Building consensus: Do try to get aligned, but don’t block on full consensus. If rough consensus can’t get you to a conclusion and you’re not ready to flip a coin, someone will need to make the call. If there’s nobody in that role, you could ask your sponsor to adjudicate, but make this a last resort.
  * Not deciding is a decision (just usually not a good one)
    * Remember that you usually don’t need to make the best decision, just a good enough decision. If you’re stuck, timebox it.
    * When the time and energy you would need to invest in deciding just isn’t worth any of the benefits the decision will give you, when getting it wrong carries heavy penalties and getting it right carries little reward, or when you suspect the situation might just go away on its own. But the key is that you decide not to decide. You add “make no decision (status quo)” to your list of options and deliberately choose it.
  * Show your work: Be empathetic and try to solve everyone’s problems when you can, but make a decisive call and show why you chose what you chose.
* Get Aligned and Stay Aligned
  * Keep your sponsor up to date on what you’re planning and how it’s going. Take the time to get your thoughts together so that you can bring them a summary of how you’re approaching various problems and what your options are.
  * Your path should be aspirational, but not impossible.
  * Nemawashi - one of the pillars of the Toyota Production System. It means sharing information and laying the foundations so that by the time a decision is made, there’s already a consensus of opinion.
  * Work on your story:
    * the pithy one-liner or “bumper sticker” slogan can really shine.
    * If your teams know, understand, and keep repeating the story of where they’re going, you’re much more likely to get there.
    * Make sure the story is comprehensible. A short, coherent story is much more compelling than a list of unconnected tasks.
    * Make sure the story is relatable. If you will need work from other teams, show how your work will make their lives better too.
    * Overton window. A compelling story to take people on a journey from A to B will only work if they’re actually at A.
* Create the Final Draft

#### The Launch
* An officially endorsed document gives people a tool they can use for making decisions.
* Keep it fresh: Shipping a vision or strategy doesn’t mean you can stop thinking about it. The business direction or broader technical context may change and you’ll need to adapt. You may also just find out that the direction you chose was wrong. Be prepared to revisit your document in a year, or earlier if you realize that it’s not working. If the vision or strategy is no longer solving your business problems, iterate on it. Explain what new information you have or what’s changed, update it, and tell a new story.

## Execution
### Resource constraints
* Time
* Energy
  * How many things are you already doing?
  * Does this kind of work give or take energy?
  * Are you procrastinating?
  * Is this fight worth it?
* Quality of life
  * Do you enjoy this work?
  * How do you feel about the project’s goals?
* Credibility
  * Does this project use your technical skills?
  * Does this project show your leadership skills?
* Social capital
  * Is this the kind of work that your company and your manager expects at your level?
  * Will this work be respected?
  * Are you squandering the capital you’ve built?
* Skills
  * Will this project teach you something you want to learn?
  * Will the people around you raise your game?

### Choosing projects
What If It’s the Wrong Project?
* Do it anyway?
* Compensate for the project
* Let others lead
* Resize the project
* Just don’t do it

### Leading big projects
What makes a great project lead? It’s rarely genius: it’s perseverance, courage, and a willingness to talk to other people.

#### The start of a project
##### If you're feeling overwhelmed
* It’s normal to feel overwhelmed when you’re beginning a project. It takes time and energy to build the mental maps that let you navigate it all, and at the start of the project it might feel like more than you can handle.
* Create an anchor for yourself: for example, a document just for yourself.
* Talk to your project sponsor: Understand who’s sponsoring this project and what they’ll want you to do for them. Then get some time with them. Go in prepared with a clear (ideally, written) description of what you think they’re hoping to achieve from the project and what success looks like.
* Decide who gets your uncertainty. Try to find at least one person who you can be open and unsure with. This might be your manager, a mentor, or a peer
* Give yourself a win: You can preface any statement with “I’m new to this, so tell me if I have this wrong, but here’s what I think we’re doing” and learn a lot.
* Use your strengths: If you’re most comfortable with code, jump in. If you tend to go first to relationships, talk to people. If you’re a reader, go get the documents. Probably your preferred place to start won’t give you all of the information you need, but it’ll be a good place to start convincing your brain that this is just another project.

##### Building Context
* Goals
* Customer needs
* Success metrics: Describe how you’ll measure your success. If you’re creating a new feature, maybe there’s already a proposed way to measure success, like a product requirements document (PRD). If not, you might be proposing your own metrics. Will it mean more revenue from users, fewer outages, a process that takes less time? Is there an objective metric you can set up now that will let you compare before and after?
* Sponsors, stakeholders, and customers: If the impetus for the work has come from you, then you might be on the hook to continually justify the project and make sure it stays funded. It will be easier to sell the value of the work if you can find other people who want it too.
* Fixed constraints: deadline, budget, dependencies, difficult people
* Risks: mitigate risk by being clear about your areas of uncertainty. What don’t you know, and what approaches can you take that will make those less ambiguous? Is this the sort of thing you can prototype? Has someone done this kind of project before? Make frequent iterative changes, you have a better chance of getting user feedback and course-correcting
* History
* Team: you may have contacts or subleads on each of several other teams. Some of those subleads may be directing work for their own subleads.

##### Giving Your Project Structure
* Define roles
  * lay out each leader’s responsibilities
  * RACI, or responsibility assignment matrix
    * Responsible: The person actually doing the work.
    * Accountable: The person ultimately delivering the work and responsible for signing off that it’s done. There’s supposed to be only one accountable person per task, and it will often be the same person as whoever is “Responsible.”
    * Consulted: People who are asked for their opinion.
    * Informed: People who will be kept up to date on progress.
  * If you’re the project lead, you are ultimately responsible for the project. That means you’re implicitly filling any roles that don’t already have someone in them, or at least making sure the work gets done.
* Recruiting people
* Agreeing on scope:
  * Set milestone with dates
  * Use milestones as beta tests: every milestone is usable or demonstrable in some way, and gives the users or stakeholders an extra opportunity to give feedback.
  * Other ways to split work: workstreams, phases
* Estimating time
* Agreeing on logistics
  * When, where, and how you’ll meet
  * How you’ll encourage informal communication
  * How you’ll all share status
  * Where the documentation home will be
  * What your development practices will be
* Having a kickoff meeting
  * Topics:
    * Who everyone is
    * What the goals of the project are
    * What’s happened so far
    * What structures you’ve all set up
    * What’s happening next
    * What you want people to do
    * How people can ask questions and find out more

#### Driving the project
* Exploring
  * What are the important aspects of the project?
  * What possible approaches can you take?
* Clarifying
  * Mental models: Give people a head start by providing a convenient, memorable name for the concept, using an analogy, or connecting it back to something they already understand, to help people build their own mental models of what you’re talking about.
  * Naming: use others' words to communicate when you can, provide a glossary, or at least be deliberate about describing the terms you’re using.
  * Pictures and graphs
* Designing
* Coding
  * If you’re contributing code at the expense of more difficult, more important things. This is a form of the snacking.
  * Think of your code as a lever to help everyone else.
  * Aim for your solutions to empower your team, not to take over from them.
  * Rather than taking on every important change yourself, find opportunities for other people to grow, by chatting over the details or pair programming on the change.
* Communicating
  * Talking to each other: Find opportunities for your team members to talk with each other regularly and build relationships, even (or maybe especially) on fully remote teams. You can make relationship building easier with shared meetings, friendly Slack channels, demos, and social events. If you have a small number of teams, key people from adjacent teams can attend each other’s meetings or standups. The goal is comfortable familiarity.
  * Sharing status: Your project has other people who care about it: stakeholders, sponsors, customer teams who are waiting for you to be done. Make it easy for them to find out what’s going on, and set their expectations about when you’ll reach various milestones.
* Navigating

### Stopping a project
* Blocked
  * General techniques
    * Understand and explain
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support: It’s easier to get work prioritized when you can show that it’s an organizational objective. You’ll demonstrate the value of the work so that you can get that support. And sometimes you’ll escalate to get help getting past a blockage.
    * Make alternative plans
  * Blocked by another team
    * Understand and explain: Explain why the work is important, and spell out what you’re hoping they’ll deliver and by when. Give them another chance to tell you whether that’s realistic, or whether there’s something else they can do that would solve your problem.
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support:
      * It’s easier to get work prioritized when you can show that it’s an organizational objective. You’ll demonstrate the value of the work so that you can get that support. And sometimes you’ll escalate to get help getting past a blockage.
      * If your blocked project is genuinely more important, this may be a case for escalation to a mutual leader. No matter how frustrated you are, deliver the unemotional facts: explain what you need, why it’s important, and what’s not happening. Consider discussing the situation with your project sponsor or manager before escalating. They may have alternatives to suggest, or may be willing to have some of those conversations for you.
    * Make alternative plans: That might mean rescoping your project, choosing a different direction, or shipping later than you’d intended to.
  * Blocked by a decision
    * Understand and explain
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support
    * Make alternative plans:
      * Alternatively, sometimes it’s OK to make your best guess about the right path and take the risk that you’re wrong. If you do guess, document the trade-offs and the decision.1 Make sure the decider knows that you’re guessing and understands the implications of the direction you chose. Spend some time thinking about the worst that could happen and what you might later wish you’d done, and mitigate those risks in any way you can.
      * It may be time to accept that you just can’t continue the work for now. If that’s the case, talk to your project sponsor, tell them what you’ve tried, and make sure they agree that it’s not possible to proceed.
  * Blocked by a single button click
    * Understand and explain: Bear in mind that other teams often take on accountability when they give approval.
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support
    * Make alternative plans
  * Blocked by a single person
    * Understand and explain: Consider setting an earlier go/no-go deadline after which you’ll both understand that they’re not going to be ready in time and you should find an alternative approach.
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support
    * Make alternative plans
  * Blocked by unassigned work
    * Understand and explain
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support
    * Make alternative plans
  * Blocked by a huge crowd of people
    * Understand and explain
    * Make the work easier
    * Get organizational support
    * Make alternative plans

* Nobody's using it - selling it
  * The best software in the world doesn’t matter if users don’t know it exists or aren’t convinced it’s worth their time. You need to do the marketing.
  * Tell people: You don’t just need to tell people that the solution exists: you need to keep telling them. Help them find it. Send emails, do road shows, get a slot at the engineering all-hands. Offer white-glove service to specific customers who are likely to advocate for you afterward. If you’re in a shared office, consider putting up posters! Get testimonials. Understand what anyone might be wary of, or unenthusiastic about, and make sure your marketing shows that you’ve thought about (and hopefully fixed) those problems. Be persistent and keep telling people until they start telling each other.
  * Make it discoverable: Whatever you’ve created, make it easy to find. This means linking to it from anywhere its intended users are likely to look for it. If you have multiple documentation platforms, make sure a search on any of them will end up at the right place. If your company uses a shortlink service, set up links for all of the likely names, including the misspellings and any hyphenations people are likely to guess.

* It’s Built on a Shaky Foundation
  * It’s when a prototype or minimum viable product has gone into production and the users can use it pretty well, but everyone knows that it’s hacked together. There might be good reasons to ship something as cheaply and quickly as possible. But when the team has moved on, that cheap solution remains in place.
  * Shoring up the foundations
    * Set a culture of quality
    * Make the foundational work a user story
    * Negotiate for engineer-led time

## Leveling Up
### Be a role model
* Be competent
  * Know things
    * Build experience: Experience comes through time, exposure, and study.
    * Build domain knowledge
    * Stay up to date
  * Be self-aware
    * Admit what you know
    * Admit what you don’t know
    * Understand your own context
  * Have High Standards
    * Seek out constructive criticism
    * Own your mistakes:
      * Don’t beat yourself up, but don’t deny the impact or insist that the mistake wasn’t really your fault. Admit what happened, then set out to fix it. Communicate quickly and clearly and make sure everyone has the information they need. If there’s any risk that someone else will get blamed, clarify that they didn’t do anything wrong. If you hurt someone else’s feelings, acknowledge the hurt and apologize.
      * If you caused an outage or took an expensive wrong path, consider having a retrospective afterward where you talk through what happened, how you recovered, and what you learned. Be open and matter-of-fact about the part you played.
    * Be reliable: it builds up as people see you do the work and get things under control. Be the sort of person who is trusted to get it done well. Part of reliability is also finishing what you start.
* Be Responsible
  * Take Ownership: Senior people own the whole problem. Ownership also means using your own good judgment: you don’t need to constantly ask for permission or check whether you’re doing the right thing. Signal what you’re about to do before you do it.
  * Make decisions: Owning decisions includes accepting that you might be wrong. Make the cost of a wrong decision as low as possible, and if it turns out that you are wrong, own that, too.
  * Ask “obvious” questions: One of the best things about being senior is that you can ask questions that are so obvious, nobody else is willing to ask them. As a leader, you have a responsibility to make the implicit explicit.
  * Don’t delegate through neglect: If glue work is needed for your organization or your project, recognize it and understand who is doing it. Take ownership and do a lot of the work that’s not anybody’s job but that furthers your goals. Redirect your junior colleagues toward tasks that will develop their careers instead.
  * Take Charge
    * Step up in an emergency: coordinating only works if everyone knows you’re coordinating. If you don’t take charge explicitly, you’ll just be one more person making noise. A few ways to do this are to take clear notes, make sure that everyone involved in the emergency has the same context, and ask everyone to radiate intent about what they’re doing and when.
    * Ask for more information when everyone is confused
    * Drive meetings
      * Step up when it’s needed. Make sure there is an agenda: collect items to discuss at the start of the meeting, or set the example of sending around the agenda in advance. Remember what you’re hoping to get out of the meeting, and drag it back to that topic if it goes too far astray.
      * Meeting notes are a great example of glue work.
      * You can record the facts you think are most important, document decisions made, and be the first to frame the decision. Then you can invite everyone to confirm what you wrote. As a moderator, if you need to give everyone a moment to think and reflect, you can also say, “Wait a moment, I need to catch up with the notes.” They’re a useful flow control for the meeting.
    * If you see something, say something: Use your position as a leader and speak up.
  * Create calm
    * Defuse, don’t amplify: Be especially clear in one-on-ones with other leaders about whether you’re asking for action, unpacking something for yourself, or sharing context. They might reflexively react and amplify something that you’d just intended to blow off steam about.
    * Avoid blame
    * Be consistent: create a sense of safety and calm by being consistent and predictable. Your colleagues should know what they can expect if they ask you to help with something. During times of change or difficulty, the way you show up and express yourself at work can reassure your colleagues.
* Remember the Goal
  * Remember There’s a Business
    * Adapt to the situation
    * Be aware that there’s a budget
    * Spend resources mindfully
  * Remember There’s a User
  * Remember There’s a Team
  * Look ahead
    * It’s OK to plant some seeds that you won’t personally see grow.
    * Anticipate What You’ll Wish You’d Done
    * Telegraph what’s coming: Be clear about what your broad direction is, even if you don’t know the details yet.
    * Tidy up: take the time to leave your production environment, codebase, or documentation so that it just works for whoever comes along next. Write tests that will let you refactor your code without breaking things. Follow your style guide so that the people who copy your approach will also be following your style guide.
    * Keep your tools sharp: Look for optimizations that will let you build, deploy, and release more quickly: smaller builds, intuitive tooling, fixing or deleting flaky tests, repeatable processes, automation everywhere. Be judicious about where you invest: building tooling, platforms, or processes takes time, so choose the optimizations that will genuinely make a difference.
    * Create institutional memory: you can send information into the future by writing things down. This includes decision records that explain what you were thinking, systems diagrams that include the obvious things that “everyone knows,” and code comments that include context on what’s going on.
    * Expect Failure: Build the expectation of failure into your products: test the error paths as thoroughly as the success paths, and make the product do something sensible and user-friendly when it doesn’t get the kind of response it expects. Make sure you’ll find out when your systems aren’t behaving, and have a plan for how you’ll respond to it. Plan in advance for major incidents by adding some conventions around how you work together during an emergency
    * Optimize for Maintenance, Not Creation: Software gets maintained for much longer than it takes to create it, so don’t build code that’s hard to maintain.
      * Make it understandable
      * Keep it simple
      * Build to decommission
    * Create Future Leaders: The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication of how successful you’ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.
