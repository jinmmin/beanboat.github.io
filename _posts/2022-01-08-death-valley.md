Death Valley is attractive just by its name. In the old times, people who came to this area usually had a difficult time crossing it alive because of its vastness and extreme whether. Even in our trip during the last Christmas, it could be very hot when walking in the sun.

## Camping
Our trip lasted 5 days. We used a rental car to drive around. As usual, we slept in our green tent in the [Panamint Springs campground](https://www.panamintsprings.com/accommodations/camping-rv). The ground there is sandy and not really the best for camping. Our tent almost got blown away on one day. We got back and found the tent was lying on the side. It was still there only because some kind neighbor helped put rocks on the edge.

## Red Rock Canyon
The colored rocks are common in districts around Las Vegas, especially red rocks. The redness is from the iron inside. This also seems to be a popular place for climbing.

## Badwater Basin
The most amazing part of Death Valley is its diverse landscape. Badwater Basin is one of the representative spots. A large amount of salt has formed hexagonal shapes expanded from the Earth crust. The result is fascinating. It is also one of the most popular tourist attraction in Death Valley.

## Mosaic Canyon
This is an easy hike to have a taste of the canyons. The feature of the canyons here are the colorful walls, both in color and texture.

## Mesquite sand dune
The Mesquite sand dune is very easy to access. It is just next to the road. And it is also a good place for stargazing. Stargazing is more of a summer activity, as stars are more clear and the winter night in Death Valley is also chilly.

## Wildrose Peak
Wildrose Peak trailhead is located at the historic Wildrose Charcoal Kilns. The peak is covered in snow in winter, which is a big difference from other hikes in Death Valley.

## Darwin Falls
This is a short and delightful hike. To the end that is close to the Fall, the road is a bit hidden and you would need to do a little climbing. But it is like a tiny oasis in the desert.

## Golden Canyon circuit
This is my favorite hike in this trip, especially the second part, which is less frequently visited. You have multiple chances to have an overview of the canyons. Close to the end the canyon, the view opens up all of a sudden in a shockingly amazing way.

## Devil's Hole
We came here to see the unique pupfish. They are tiny rare fishes that are near distinct. The hole is deep and provides a hidden home for the fishes. The mountain around is spotted by red, variously sized cactus, which is exotic.

## Ash Meadows National wildlife Refuge
We stopped by the refuge in the last day of the trip. Not really much there in winter. But we did almost bump into a lynx on the road there. Likely there are plenty more chances to spot wildlife in the warmer seasons.
