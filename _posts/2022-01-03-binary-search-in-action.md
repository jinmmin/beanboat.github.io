Binary search is a topic that is easy to explain but hard to implement bug-free. Some example of the most common problems are:
* How to initialize the boundary
* When to exit the loop
* How to update the boundary, i.e. where to shrink

### Boundary
The boundary is the range of elements we will be searching from. The initial boundary should include ALL the element.
```
int l = min(search_space), r = max(search_space)
```
For arrays, it looks:
```
int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
```
LeetCode 35 "Search Insert Position" asks to find an index to insert into the array. It is possible to insert after the last element of the array. Thus the boundary becomes:
```
int l = 0, r = nums.length;
```

### Calculate mid
```
int mid = l + (r - l) / 2      // left/lower mid
int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2  // right/upper mid
int mid = r - (r - l) / 2      // right/upper mid
```

### Templates
#### Template 1
```
l = min(search_space), r = max(search_space)
while l < r:
  mid = l + (r - l) / 2    # left / lower
  if checkOk(mid):
    r = mid                # right moves
  else:
    l = mid + 1
return l
```

#### Template 2
```
l = min(search_space), r = max(search_space)
while l < r:
  mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2   # right / upper
  if checkOk(mid):
    l = mid                   # left moves up
  else:
    r = mid - 1
return l
```

### Steps
* Initialize the boundary to include all possible elements.
* Decide return value. After exiting the while loop, left is the minimal one satisfying the condition function.
* Design the condition function. This is the most difficult part and needs a lot of practice.
* Check [0, 1] and switch the mid calculation if needed, to avoid infinite loop.
